# Privacy Policy

**Last Modified: 2025-10-08**

Taddy Artist Database Inc. (“we,” “us,” or “Taddy Inc.”) provides the Antler mobile application (“Antler” or “App”). 

This Privacy Policy explains our data practices for Antler.

---

## 1. Information We Do NOT Collect

Antler is a **local-first application**. We have no servers, no databases, and no analytics systems. We do not collect, store, or process any of your personal information.

## 2. Information Stored Locally on Your Device

All data you create on Antler is stored locally on your mobile device, including:

### 2.1 Profile Data

- Any profile your create
- Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) generated for each profile
- Profile photos or avatars (if you add them)

### 2.2 App Data

- QR code scan history
- App settings and preferences
- Cached web content (managed by your device’s WebView)

**This data is stored only on your device and is never transmitted to Taddy Inc. or any servers we control.**

## 3. How Your Data May Be Shared with Third Parties

### 3.1 Third-Party Web Applications

When you scan a QR code and access a third-party web application:

- **You choose** what profile information to share
- The web application receives the data you authorize through the WebView
- **The web application (not Antler)** controls what happens to that data thereafter
- Each web application has its own privacy practices and data collection policies

**We are not responsible for third-party web application data practices.** These are independent websites and services outside our control. Always review a website’s privacy practices before sharing your information.

### 3.2 Data Transmission

Data shared with third-party web applications is transmitted directly from your device to the website’s server. This communication does not pass through Taddy Inc. infrastructure.

## 4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

### 4.1 Antler App

Antler does not use cookies, tracking pixels, or any analytics tools.

### 4.2 Third-Party Websites

Third-party web applications loaded when you scan a QR code may use cookies and tracking technologies according to their own privacy policies. We have no control over these practices.

## 5. How to Delete Your Data

### 5.1 Deleting your Antler Data

To delete all Antler data:
1. **Uninstall the App** from your device
2. All profiles, DIDs, and scan history will be permanently deleted as they are stored locally.

### 5.2 Data Deletion from Third-Party Websites

If you shared data with third-party web applications, you must contact those websites directly to request deletion. We cannot delete data held by third parties.

## 6. Contact Us

If you have questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or your privacy rights:

**Email:** `danny@antlerbrowser.com`

For issues with third-party web application data practices, please contact the website developer directly.
