# Open-Source
Antler is an [open-source](https://github.com/antler-browser/antler) monorepo with multiple applications:

[Mobile App](https://github.com/antler-browser/antler/blob/main/react-native/README.md) - React Native  / Expo app.

[Website](https://github.com/antler-browser/antler/blob/main/website/README.md) - HTML / CSS / Markdown.

## IRL Browser Standard

Antler uses an [open standard](./irl-browser-standard.html) to pass data between the app to your website. When users scan your QR code, their profile details on Antler get shared to your site - no auth friction, instant login, no account creation.

**Why open standards matter:** Being an open-standard means anyone can create an alternative to Antler. This means you gets the benefits of integrating with Antler and know you are not locked into a closed platform.

## Examples:

Here are some example apps you can fork to get started:
