# Open-Source

Antler is an [open-source](https://github.com/antler-browser/antler) monorepo with multiple applications:

[Mobile App](https://github.com/antler-browser/antler/blob/main/react-native/README.md) - React Native  / Expo app.

[Website](https://github.com/antler-browser/antler/blob/main/website/README.md) - HTML / CSS / Markdown.

## IRL Browser Standard

Antler uses an open standard to pass data between the app to your website. When users scan your QR code, their profile details on Antler get shared to your site - no auth friction, no account creation, instant login.

Check out our [how-to guide](./irl-browser-standard-technical-specification.html) to see how to receive data from Antler in your web app, or dive into the code examples below.

**Why open standards matter:** Being an open-standard means anyone can create an alternative to Antler. This means you are not locked into a closed platform.
